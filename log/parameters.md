Space to adjust the boid behaviour wiothout breaking the simulation is very narrow. Displaying SAC weights this obfuscated through [[Frame]] for a third party to adjust would in most cases reduce the emergent behaviour of boids. I should look into other ways "players" can influence state without breaking it. Avoid direct influence from input. Beacause, "Oh cool your mouse scared them away" novelty will wear off faster than it's effect on the environment ripples away. 

## Ideas
- Add different object types into the scene. These could be obstacles, attractors, predators, leaders, etc.
- Drawing or weighting paths that the boids might follow. long range: let players import/create flow fields, noise, turbulence. Debating between giving them a way to erase paths (then your broken [[Frame]] is your own fault) and heavily limiting what paths can be added 
- Mixing these together: some attractor blooms around happy B1, primary boid flock. Predators can be added to the scene, which chase B1. B1 `fear` increases as predators enter `radius` temporarily boosting maxspeed. Attractor does not grow if there are no nearby B1, Attractor decays if neaby B1 have high `fear`. Render `attractor growth` on [[Frame]]. Render fear on [[Frame]]?
