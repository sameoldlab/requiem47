This project has two spearate, but connected parts. Frame: a window to view the model. A live window specifically, not an artifact, snapshot, or export. Model: a simulation of some natural process. It's not possible to view nature in it's enteirety, all we have are maps. My goal is to explore the possible, incomplete maps that can be pulled from a single model, splicing through a specific dimension. 
My end goal is to create a canvas that acts as a view through a window rather than a snapshot or artifact. A canvas on it's own would be blank, so to go with that would be something worth looking at. The interaction between the two should create a 
the object on the other side should be interesting enought to view from multiple angles or dimensions. By mapping each frame to time or some property, each viewer gets a a unique 

cTimeline:
Week 1-1.5: Creating simulations and look dev in Blender (boids and either growth or decay)
Week 1.5-3: Move to a live environment (most likely WebGL) 
Week 4: Map simulation to 2D plane. Make it interactive.
